# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
- The purpose of this analysis was to examine given rideshare data and create a dataframe that would display this data by city type (Rural, Suburban, and Urban). After examining this data and formatting the data frame to standards, we created a line graph that clearly shows an overview of how rideshare fares changed weekly from the months of January through April.
## Results
- As expected, results show that total fares produced by Urban cities trumped that of both Suburban and Rural. The average fare per driver in Rural cities was seen to be almost triple that of Urban cities, which was to be expected as Urban areas generally cover a much larger area. Urban cities dominated the total fare produced, whcih was also to be assumed since these cities contain the majority of rideshare drivers. All areas follow a similar pattern, a sudden increase in fare towards the end of the month of February.  Surprisingly, the total rideshare fare produced by Suburban cities is seen to take a large upturn towards the middle of April. This can be validated as both the rideshare fare for Rural and Urban start to decline in that same time period. ![ridesharedata](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35403433/127808012-69c98fe9-bd0b-4617-8e84-f701ca23ec9a.png)

## Summary
- Summarizing this data, we have created a means for someone to easily evaluate which fare should be charged upon area type. Although we did not explore each city and therefore provide a more complex analysis, it should be viable for the rideshare company to evaluate changes that can be made. For instance, three recommendations that could be made would be:
  1. Have drivers assigned to different city types based off of what type of cities they normally work in.
  2. Instill increases or decreases in rideshare fare based upon which months business is slower.
  3. Charge more per mile within Urban areas as these trips are likely to be much slower when compared with Suburban and Rural areas and thus drivers will not make as much.
